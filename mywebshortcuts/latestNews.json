    "content": "It's been a long... long... time since the last update, and yeah, I know—I’ve been lazy. 😅 But these past two months, I dedicated all my free time to revamping My Web Shortcuts, and it's finally here!\n\nThere are tons of improvements, new features, and options waiting for you. Try creating a shortcut, and you’ll immediately feel the difference—whether you're an old user or new. Oh, and by the way, a premium version is now available with exclusive features like multi-element selection and more! 🏆 I’ll be putting together a guide soon to help you make the most of it.",

      "✅ Multi-key Shortcuts – Finally! No more single-character limits. Now, you can use Alt + Q, Ctrl + Shift + D, even Arrow keys, Backspace, Enter, Space, and more! 🎉",
      "🔍 Custom Regex URL – Want shortcuts that work on specific types of URLs? Use Regex-based matching for powerful customization. (Premium feature)",
      "⚡ More Actions – New actions are here, though some of the best ones (like Cycle Through Elements) are premium-only. This lets you navigate through multiple elements effortlessly.",
      "🎯 Multiple Selectors – Choose the best selector for your needs. For example, use text content selection when targeting text-based elements.",
      "🎨 Highlighting Options – Highlight focusable elements only (buttons, links, etc.) or focus highlighted elements (so hovering over an input field moves the cursor inside automatically).",
      "🖱 Selector Auto-Move – Press Alt twice, and the selector will automatically move away from your cursor, making element selection much easier.",
      "🧪 Test Before Confirming – No more guesswork! A Test button lets you verify if an element is correctly selected before finalizing.",
      "🔄 Multiple Elements Selection – Ever wanted to click a bunch of elements sequentially? Now you can! Set delays, customize actions, and automate repetitive clicks with a shortcut. 🖲"
